# Algorithms
Git library for ~~my~~ contest-solving algorithms.

Some code can be (definitely is...) very, VERY bad-style due "competitive" speedy-rush solving.
If it passes task - probably, I will not change it to be more readable. If failed due something else (passes only open tests) - probably, I will beautify it.
